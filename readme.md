# sad-reacts-only  
---  
Scary starter kit. Everything is not in place yet. Expect nothing.
  
## What's included  
  
- React (16.x)
- Redux (3.7)
- Apollo Client (2.2.x)
- GraphQL (0.12)

## Side note  
  
- While rethinkdb is included in package, I didn't set it up yet. still thinking of a better way to do things on the back end.
- Production mode is not developed yet. The sole intention of this repo is to experiment on things and come up with better one.
- Heavily relies on Babel
- eslint is yet to come
- no final CSS framework to be used yet. blueprint is good for huge data, but I may change it depending on the needs.
- ISDK why i need loadCSS
